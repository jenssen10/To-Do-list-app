# ToDoListApp

Simple static ToDo list application (HTML/CSS/JS) that stores tasks in the browser `localStorage`.

Run locally:

1. Open `c:/Users/jenss/Downloads/My-Portfolio/ToDoListApp/index.html` in your browser.

Or serve with a tiny static server (recommended for consistent behavior):

```powershell
cd 'c:/Users/jenss/Downloads/My-Portfolio/ToDoListApp'
python -m http.server 8000
# then open http://localhost:8000 in your browser
```

Features:
- Add tasks
- Mark complete/uncomplete
- Edit tasks (double-click)
- Delete tasks
- Filter (All / Active / Completed)
- Persisted to browser `localStorage`

Next ideas: sync to backend, user accounts, due dates, drag-and-drop ordering.
